# Computer-Science-Notes
This repository contains my notes on various computer science topics. Most of the content comes from the source Lynda, which provides a vast number of tutorials on software, creative, and business skills.

If you find any issues with my notes (i.e. missing something important or something isn't clear), please create an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy learning!
