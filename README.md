# Computer-Science-Notes
This repository contains my notes on various computer science topics. Most of the content comes from the source Lynda, which provides a vast number of tutorials on software, creative, and business skills.

If you find any issues with my notes (i.e. missing something important or something isn't clear), please create an issue or submit a pull request.

Please note that some of my notes are incomplete at the time of this writing. This is because I have not yet finished the entire tutorial, but those notes will be regularly updated as I complete the tutorial. The following notes are incomplete:

- Discrete Mathematics
- HTML
- IP Addressing
- Installing Apache, MySQL, and PHP
- Python Essential Training
- R Statistics Essential Training
- XML Essential Training

I hope you find these notes useful. Happy learning!
